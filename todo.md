## To-do

* Bypass string creation, comparison, and searching by implementing a byte array/bytewise version of each.

* Move javascript into another file
* Maybe move markup (html) into another file

* Fix downloads so they have the right name (add command parameter to urls for downloads, and let the URI be the image name?)
* Set permissions on directories, and set default file location to a folder.
    * password protection option

* Further improve interface
    * Try Settings Activity

* Bandwidth in tests varied from 100-600 kBps, depending on processing or connection/distance from access point.
    Use profiling and refactoring to improve those speeds and make them reliable, if possible
