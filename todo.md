## To-do

* Bypass string creation, comparison, and searching by implementing a byte array/bytewise version of each.

* Move rest of the javascript into another file
* Move markup (html) into another file

* Sorting
    * Allow sorting by name
    * Make sorting spans appear "clickable" (change mouse cursor)

* change default (unprivileged) folder?

* hint file size on file downloads in header

* Further improve interface
    * Try Settings Activity

* Bandwidth in tests varied from 100-600 kBps, depending on processing or connection/distance from access point.
    Use profiling and refactoring to improve those speeds and make them reliable, if possible
